LOAD"TESTx.PRG",8,1
RUN

When the test is run the border color changes to violet to indicate the test
is running.
After some minutes the border changes to green (success) or flashes (failure).

Test number/address is shown, as is reference and measured value in case
of failure. Detected CIA type (old/new) is also shown.

test*.prg use reference data measured with a real C64 (irqX.dump).

irqX_dtv.dump are measured with a PAL DTV3 (detected as old CIA);
tests 3 and 3b give the same results as C64.

Use record*.prg to measure your own data (stored at $2000-$A000).

TODO: automatically compile DTV tests as well
