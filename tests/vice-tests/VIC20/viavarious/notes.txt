via1:
    1482: dotest2 (set VIA-1 to defaults)

    148B: actual test called:

    1493: .setdefaults

    2000: measured data
    3000: reference data
            
            for X=0 to 256:
                load VIA register
                store in $1000 + X

    test registers:
            $9114       fail
            $9115       fail
            $9116       pass
            $9117       pass
            $9118       pass
            $9119       pass

    next two tests are different:

        fail:
            #$00 => $911B
            for X=0 to 256:
                $9118 => $1000 + X
        pass:
            #$00 => $911B
            for X=0 to 256:
                $9119 => $1000 + X
